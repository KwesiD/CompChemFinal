1) Remove methyl from 102 while docked to 5J0D. Minimize and compare this result to the 
minimized 100 that was docked using Vina.  This would be to validate our methods. 

2) Look at the interaction between the water and the ligand directly.

3) Look at the residue interactons (we have the files in All.UU file from cpptraj)
	We should then take the distance data and label it onto our diagrams
